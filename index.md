This is a website setup for the workshop proposal to ICRA 2025, **Robots in the Wild**.

## Abstract

In the field, we throw **robots into the wild** to achieve what seems a simple task, that quickly ends up being arduous. As experts, we continuously loop through inferring, developing, deploying, and analyzing our autonomous systems until it meets some level of success. From marine to forestry, from mining to agriculture, no matter the various applications, field robotics is an ambitious area of work. The standards of success are rising, given the advancements in robot designs and algorithmic frameworks, but so too are new challenges arising, limiting the advancement of field robotics. 

This workshop brings together experts and new enthusiasts from various subdomains of field robotics — such as marine, aerial, legged, agriculture, search and rescue robotics — to showcase not only the achievements in state-of-the-art field robotics, but more importantly the respective open challenges. Open questions for each subdomain that the workshop will explore include: What are the common and unique challenges? What are possible solutions? Can solutions to these challenges generalize to other subdomains? What problems should we focus more on? 

Accordingly, the shared perspectives from the various subdomains will foster the identification of shared challenges and solutions, encourage networking, project inspirations, and new collaborations.
