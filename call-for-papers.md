**Submission Link: To Be Setup. ** <!-- [Microsoft CMT3](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICRARW2025) -->

We invite interested authors to submit a 2-8 pages paper, in English, as PDF in the standard ICRA IEEE conference format (templates [LaTeX](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) or [Microsoft Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php)). We encourage contributions of research papers describing early research on emerging topics and early results. Note that these contributions are not archival.

A video (up to 10 MB) can be added to supplement your paper. Videos are not mandatory. Rather it’s an opportunity to augment one’s paper to visibly showcase results. MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used.

All submissions will go through a single-blind review process. Authors of accepted papers are expected to give a lightning talk (3 minutes) and to present a poster at the workshop. A number of papers will be selected for a 15 minutes oral presentation. All accepted papers will be available in the workshop Website.
